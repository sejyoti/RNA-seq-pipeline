## Introduction

`rnaseqpipeline` is a Nextflow pipeline for analyzing RNA-seq data. The pipeline uses the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline as a base, and adds additional custom steps for specific analyses.

## Installation

1. Install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) (version 20.01.0 or later)
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (version 19.03 or later) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html) (version 3.0 or later)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


2. Edit the `nextflow.config` file to configure the pipeline settings
3. Run the pipeline with Nextflow:

nf-core/rnaseq is a Nextflow-based analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data, built using best practices from the nf-core community.

## Usage

To run the pipeline, you will need to have Nextflow and Docker installed on your system. You can then run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq --reads /path/to/reads --outdir /path/to/output -profile docker


For more information on how to run the pipeline, please refer to the nf-core/rnaseq documentation.



# RNA-seq pipeline using nf-core

This pipeline is based on nf-core RNA-seq, a best-practice pipeline for quality control and quantification of RNA sequencing data. The pipeline uses Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. 

## Installation

To use this pipeline, you will need to have Nextflow and Docker installed on your system. You can install Nextflow by following the instructions on the Nextflow website. Docker can be downloaded from the Docker website.

## Usage

To run the RNA-seq pipeline using this Nextflow script, you can use the following command:

nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq \
    --reads /path/to/reads \
    --outdir /path/to/output \
    -profile docker


This command will run the pipeline using the `docker` profile, which will automatically download and use the Docker container that contains all of the required software and dependencies.

For more information on how to run the pipeline, please refer to the nf-core/rnaseq documentation.

## Output

The RNA-seq pipeline will generate the following output files:

- Gene-level counts (`counts/counts.genes.txt`)
- Transcript-level counts (`counts/counts.transcripts.txt`)
- Alignment statistics (`results/logs/star_alignment.log`)

## nf-core badges

This pipeline is built using nf-core, which is a framework for building reusable, modular and scalable bioinformatics workflows. nf-core pipelines adhere to a set of community-driven guidelines to ensure reproducibility and usability.

The nf-core community has developed badges that can be added to the README files of pipelines that follow these guidelines. These badges show that the pipeline has passed automated testing, and indicate the quality and stability of the pipeline.

[![nf-core](https://img.shields.io/badge/nf--core-rnaseq-brightgreen.svg)](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq)
[![GitHub Actions CI Status](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/workflows/nf-core%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/actions)

The `nf-core/rnaseq` badge indicates that this pipeline is an nf-core RNA-seq pipeline. The `GitHub Actions CI Status` badge indicates the status of the continuous integration (CI) tests for this pipeline.

# Chip-Seq Pipeline using Nextflow

This repository contains code to run a ChIP-Seq pipeline using Nextflow, with instructions on how to set up and run the pipeline on a SLURM cluster.

## Usage

To run the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Create a new analysis directory and navigate to it:
2. Clone this repository:
3. Create a `nextflow.config` file with the desired process settings (executor, queue, memory, etc.).
4. Create a `design.csv` file with the experimental design (group, replicate, fastq_1, fastq_2, antibody, control).
5. Edit the `run.sh` script with the appropriate paths to the input files and run the script:
6. Track the progress of the pipeline using `tail -f nextflow.out`.

## Input Files

The input files required to run the pipeline are:

- `nextflow.config`: A configuration file specifying the process settings for the pipeline.
- `design.csv`: A design file specifying the experimental design for the ChIP-Seq experiment.
- `GRCh38.p13.genome.fa`: A reference genome assembly file in FASTA format.
- `gencode.v32.annotation.gtf`: A genome annotation file in GTF format.
- `hg38-blacklist.v2.bed`: A file containing genomic regions that should be excluded from the analysis.

## Output Files

The output files generated by the pipeline are:

- `results/`: A directory containing the results of the ChIP-Seq analysis, including BAM files, bigWig files, peak files, and other output files.
- `nextflow.out`: A log file containing information about the pipeline run.
- `nextflow.err`: A log file containing error messages, if any.

## Dependencies

To run the pipeline, you will need the following dependencies:

- Nextflow (version 21.04.0 or later)
- Docker (version 19.03.8 or later)
- SLURM (version 19.05.0 or later)
